# FaceID-Car-Security

This project was created TAMUhack 2019, a MLH hackathon held at Texas A&M.

The team members are:
- Alex Pham
- Yuri Castro
- Fernando Barragan
- Johnathan Yap

It utilizes the Smartcar and Microsoft Azure APIs:
> Smartcar: https://smartcar.com/

> Microsoft Azure: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/

This code is unaltered from submission at the hackathon, and it also relies on packages that only exist in Linux for the Javascript webcam library, so this demo will only execute on Linux (instructions are in the readme inside the node folder, executing the same way as the Smartcar API demo).
